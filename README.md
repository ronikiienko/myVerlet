# myVerlet

Simple and fast C++ physics engine oriented for handling big number of simple objects: circles and constraints  

Can handle 100k objects with 8 substeps on 60fps+  

Lowering number of substeps to 2 and pushing it's limits on 30fps+ can handle around 450k objects.  

Handles gravity, collisions, wall constraints  

Using SFML library.  

Not using GPU for physics calculations.
